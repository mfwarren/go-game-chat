go-game-chat
============

This is meant to be a lean and simple back end service to provide team communication features to mobile apps.  With the right front end code it is intended to be used to replicate the functionality of the Clash of Clans game chat.

It is a simple multi-user multi-room broadcast server.  a user can log in to a particular room and messages will be relayed to others.  In practice these messages could be PvP game logic or actual text conversation. System bots could be registered to perform additional actions for advanced gameplay.

Future versions of this will include message history and authentication
At some point a web based admin backend would be useful for viewing stats, changing configurations, and manually interacting with the chatrooms.

This project is not working yet.
